# Goku

Goku is a Static Site Generator written in Zig.

## Introduction

A static site generator (SSG) is typically run on some input source to produce a folder of html files, suitable for hosting on any HTTP server. Goku aims to be a SSG that can operate on a variety of input sources to generate static sites of up to hundreds of thousands of pages.

## Notice

> [!NOTE]  
> Goku is in its early stages. The roadmap for features is prioritized on an as-needed basis. If you want to use Goku but it's lacking a key feature you need, feel free to check out the [contributing](#contributing) section of the readme.

## Requirements

- Officially supported Zig: `0.14.0` (you can get it from the [Zig Releases page](https://ziglang.org/download/))

## Installation

Use Zig to build the application binary. With a shell open in this project's directory:

```
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

The goku binary will be available at `zig-out/bin/goku`.

## Usage

See [the docs](./site/pages/docs/site.md) on how to scaffold your first Goku site.

Once you've set up your site, you can use goku to build it:

```
goku site -o build
```

In the above example, Goku will scan `site/pages` recursively for all `.md` files, parse their yaml frontmatter for a `slug`, and then place the built sites into the `build` folder according to each page's `slug`. It will provide a build summary with the time elapsed and the source and destination directories.

Once you've built the site, you can try previewing it on your local machine using your preferred file server. For example, if you have `python3` on your system, you can try:

```
sh -c 'cd build; python3 -m http.server'
```

## Further Work

In its current form, Goku is very basic. There is no support for theming, asset management, etc. If there's a feature you'd like to see, please open a GitHub issue.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but I do request that if there's no open GitHub issue regarding your ideal change that you open one first! It's likely that I'm already working on the feature, so following this process helps to ensure that we're not spending double the time.

## Bug reports

If you find a bug in the software, please report it using the GitHub issue tracker for this project's repository.
